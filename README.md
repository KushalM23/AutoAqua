- **MoistureSensor**: Displays soil moisture levels with status indicators
- **TemperatureSensor**: Shows temperature readings with status alerts
- **ManualControl**: Provides manual override for irrigation system
- **Header**: Contains the application title and description

## Customization

### Modifying Thresholds

You can adjust the moisture and temperature thresholds in the respective components:

- `MoistureSensor.jsx`: Modify the threshold values in `getStatusColor()`
- `TemperatureSensor.jsx`: Adjust temperature ranges in `getStatusColor()`

### Styling

The application uses CSS variables for consistent theming. Main color variables can be found in `index.css`:

```css
:root {
  --primary-blue: #0077B6;
  --secondary-blue: #00B4D8;
  --light-blue: #90E0EF;
